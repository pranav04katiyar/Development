Spring is a framework that is used to develop Java applications. It is an open-source framework that is used to develop enterprise applications. It was developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. It is a lightweight framework that is used to develop loosely coupled.

- Spring Core
- Spring MVC
- Spring Boot
- Spring JDBC

### Spring Core
Spring Core is the core container of the Spring framework. It provides the basic functionalities of the Spring framework. It provides the following functionalities:

#### Inversion of Control (IoC)
Inversion of Control is a design principle that is used to develop loosely coupled applications. It is used to remove the dependency of one class on another class. It is used to develop loosely coupled applications.

#### Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that is used to inject the dependency of one class into another class. It is used to develop loosely coupled applications.

### Spring MVC
Spring MVC is a web framework that is used to develop web applications. It is built on top of the Spring Core container. It provides the following functionalities:

#### Model
Model is used to represent the data of the application. It is used to store the data of the application.

#### View
View is used to represent the user interface of the application. It is used to display the data of the application.

#### Controller
Controller is used to handle the user requests and send the response back to the user. It is used to control the flow of the application.

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a framework that is used to develop standalone applications. It is built on top of the Spring Core container. It provides the following functionalities:

#### Auto Configuration
Auto Configuration is used to automatically configure the application based on the dependencies of the application.

#### Embedded Server
Embedded Server is used to run the application without deploying it on the server.

### Spring JDBC
Spring JDBC is a framework that is used to develop database applications. It is built on top of the Spring Core container. It provides the following functionalities:

#### JdbcTemplate
JdbcTemplate is used to execute the SQL queries and retrieve the data from the database.

#### DataSource
DataSource is used to establish a connection with the database and execute the SQL queries.
